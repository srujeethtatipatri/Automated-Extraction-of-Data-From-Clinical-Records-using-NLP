Sentence,s182,Various methods to analyze breast tissue for malignancy have been proposed as screening methods for breast cancer
Sentence,s183,The trials are described in detail in the Appendix of Randomized Controlled Trials section of this summary
Sentence,s184,Such compression spreads out overlapping tissues and reduces the amount of radiation needed to image the breast
Sentence,s185,"A total of 383 ductal lavage samples were evaluated, 299 (78%) of which were adequate for diagnosis"
Sentence,s186,Cause of death attribution: Linked to Swedish Cause of Death Registry; also used an independent endpoint committee
Sentence,s187,Investigators also differ in their calculation of overdiagnosis as they adjust for characteristics such as lead-time bias
Sentence,s188,"A large concurrent cohort study compared 254,758 FFDM screens with 487,334 SFM screens and 74,190 CR screens"

Sentence,s210,The meta-analysis (follow-up methods) of the four Swedish trials also showed a small but significant improvement of all-cause mortality
Sentence,s211,A major limitation of this and other ecologic studies is the failure to account for actual exposure to screening
Sentence,s212,"There is often a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, such that higher sensitivity may be associated with lower specificity"
