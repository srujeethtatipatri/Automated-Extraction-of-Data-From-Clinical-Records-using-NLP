3. (March 9, 2020) CT scan chest, abdomen and pelvis and bone scan are
Stable, but she has two tiny new lesions on MRI of the brain.

4. Investigations (May 25, 2020 to June 1, 2020) including bone scan,

CT scan chest, abdomen and pelvis, and MRI of the head show stable
disease in the body, but some smail lesions progressing in the brain,
particularly one 5-mm lesion, the rest are questionable.

5. Molecular test (March 20, 2020): Negative for any targetable

lesions.

6. Bone scan (September 24, 2020): Stable.

7. CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis (September 24, 2020): Stable.

8. MUGA (September 8, 2020): 61%.

9. MRI of the head (October 13, 2020): There is significant concern
regarding progression of disease, patchy T2 weighted and T2 flare

signal hyperintense abnormality bilaterally, increase in size and

number compared to the prior MRI conceming for slight interval disease
progression despite the lack of definite enhancing focal parenchymal or
meningeal abnormality. Clinical correlation and followup recommended.
10. Multiple MRis on December 7, 2020 describing changes and cause for
the changes under neurological status.

11. CT scan chest, abdomen and pelvis and bone scan December 14, 2020,
Stable.

IMPRESSION
| think the February 16 MRI will be very telling as to whether or not
this is progression of cancer or just radiation necrosis of the brain.

PLAN
As above we will continue current therapy.

Unfortunately there was a mixup with Home Care and CCAC, and Hospice
went to see them and they were not ready for Hospice and we will
investigate the events that happened there.
